# lorenz-curve
My hands-on way of learning more about chaos theory via an implementation of the Lorenz equations (a.k.a. Lorenz attractor).

### The gist
Used a set of initial conditions (3 equation constants, 3 initial values for x, y and z) to simulate a erratically behaving curve.

The article on Wikipedia provides more info ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system))

Inspired by video on chaos control by Sabine Hossenfelder ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1-cwamhwag))
